# Cleaning data project for Coursera
*by Marco Antonio BÃ©jar Villalba*

## Acknowledgements

I give the proper acknowledgement to the original authors[^1] and thank them for the kindly gesture of sharing the data.

## Pourpose

This project is intended to clean the data in the [Coursera Repository](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). The data structure is described in the [UCI Maching Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and consists mainly in the following:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

## Analysis

The data contained in the original repository corresponds to samples taken in Galaxy S II cell phones of activities made by their users including:

1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

Thirty subjects participated in the exercise splitted 70% in training data and 30% in test data. The data for the test and training data also includes the data for each subject ('train/subject_train.txt' and 'test/subject_test.txt') and for each activity ('test/y_test.txt', 'train/y_train.txt').

Also the labels for the activities and measurements are included and used to tag every measurement column ('features.txt') and resolve the activities name ('activity_labels.txt') in a more descriptive way.

## Data processing

To tydifie the data first I consolidate the samples because they are splitted in 3 files one for the subject, one for the activities and one for the measurements. So, the data is merged in only one dataset for test and for training data, this is made by means of the ***getWearableComputingDS***.

After that a consolidation of the two sets is made using the ***rbind*** function achieving the first incise of the exercise (*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.*).

Only the standar deviation and mean columns of the measurements are of interest so I use the ***cleanColumns*** function to select only those of interest achieving the second incise (*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.*).

In the ***getWearableComputingDS*** function I use the 'features.txt' file to give descriptive column names to the measurements achieving the incise 3 of the instructions given by Coursera (*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set*).

The setActivitiesAsStrings function gives a descriptive name to the activities achieving the 4 incise (*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.*).

Finally a grouping is made using ***group_by*** and a summarization using ***summarise_if*** and the final incise 5 is made (*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.*).

## Notes

Data.Table is used just to test how it behaves with dplyr, both packages are needed for the script.

I use ***summarise_if*** to prevent an error trying to summarize not numeric columns.
